### Planet Formation Course - Scripts to generate plots ###

This repo contains Python scripts to generate plots relevant to my Planet Formation course (first given Autumn 2017).  

`dust_drift.py` - calculates the radial drift velocity as a function of stopping time
`evolve_viscous_ring.py` - plots the evolution of an annulus of protostellar disc material assuming a viscous prescription
`isolation_mass.py ` - calculates the isolation mass of a protoplanet feeding from a planetesimal disc (assuming the Minimum Mass Solar Nebula)
`critical_gas_capture_mass.py` - calculates the critical core mass at which the envelope is no longer in hydrostatic equilibrium.
